This repository hosts applied economic and financial projects, including data analysis scripts, portfolio analytics, and technical reports.

It reflects an ongoing work-in-progress focused on macroeconomic dynamics, financial markets, and investment analysis, using reproducible workflows in Python, R, and LaTeX.
